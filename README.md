# Image-Classification
This code was using python in Jupyter Notebook, and packages include scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy, and numpy.

The goal of this code was trying to figure out (1) transforming image into matrics (2) selecting the top five important features (3) defining the numbers of trees in the classification process and (4) classify pixels into five groups.

Jingyi_Rondom_Forest.ipynb is the main code that implement the image classification process in order to classify wild parsnip.
TryOOB.ipynb is part of the main code to get the out-of-bag error rate.

workflow

It can be divided into three parts: data preprocessing, image classification, output assessment and accuracy evaluation.
